Advanced Methods In Data Science

It cover pratice and applications of model topics including:

Causality
What is cause
there is always three explanations: X causes Y; Y causes X; and Z causes both X and Y.
Need for additional information: pure ``data’’ cannot distinguish between these explanations
Refresh R, dplyr, ggplot, rmarkdown

Causality in linear regression framework
  Before-after, cross-sectional estimators
    What is cause
    there is always three explanations: X causes Y; Y causes X; and Z causes both X and Y.
    Need for additional information: pure ``data’’ cannot distinguish between these explanations
    Refresh R, dplyr, ggplot, rmarkdown
  Linear regression: interaction terms
