Advanced Methods In Data Science

It cover pratice and applications of model topics including:

<h2>Causality</h2>
<p>What is cause<br>
there is always three explanations: X causes Y; Y causes X; and Z causes both X and Y.<br>
  Need for additional information: pure ``data’’ cannot distinguish between these explanations <br>
  Refresh R, dplyr, ggplot, rmarkdown</p>
  
<h2>Causality in linear regression framework</h2> 
<p>Before-after, cross-sectional estimators<br>
    What is cause<br>
    there is always three explanations: X causes Y; Y causes X; and Z causes both X and Y.<br>
    Need for additional information: pure ``data’’ cannot distinguish between these explanations<br>
    Refresh R, dplyr, ggplot, rmarkdown<br>
  Linear regression: interaction terms</p>
  
  
<h2>Differences-in-differences</h2>  
 <p>Differences-in-differences method<br>
  Matrices and matrix multiplication<br>
    Matrices and vectors, extremely important data structures in statistical modeling<br>
    Matrix product</p>
    
<h2>Matrices, clustering</h2>  
  K-NN, similarity and metric distance;

Convolutional networks:
  What convolutional filters do;
  Image categorization using convolutional nets;
  Tensorflow library;
    
Image recognition and generation
