Advanced Methods In Data Science

It cover pratice and applications of model topics including:

<h2>Causality</h2>
  What is cause
  there is always three explanations: X causes Y; Y causes X; and Z causes both X and Y.
  Need for additional information: pure ``data’’ cannot distinguish between these explanations
  Refresh R, dplyr, ggplot, rmarkdown

<h2>Causality in linear regression framework</h2> 
  Before-after, cross-sectional estimators
    What is cause
    there is always three explanations: X causes Y; Y causes X; and Z causes both X and Y.
    Need for additional information: pure ``data’’ cannot distinguish between these explanations
    Refresh R, dplyr, ggplot, rmarkdown
  Linear regression: interaction terms
  
  
<h2>Differences-in-differences</h2>  
  Differences-in-differences method
  Matrices and matrix multiplication
    Matrices and vectors, extremely important data structures in statistical modeling
    Matrix product
    
<h2>Matrices, clustering</h2>  
  K-NN, similarity and metric distance
  Clusters
    Supervised and unsupervised learning
    Clustering
    k-means clustering
    Hierarchical clustering

<h2>Principal components, text</h2>  
  Principal Component analysis
    Dimensionality reduction
    Principal components
  Text as data
    Text processing: lemmatization, stemming
    n-grams
    Bag of words (BOW)
    Document-term matrix (DTM)
    Use DTM for machine learning

<h2>Naive Bayes</h2>  
  Bayes Theorem
    Bayes theorem and conditional probability
